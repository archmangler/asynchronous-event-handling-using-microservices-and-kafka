# Objective

*Build three remaining consumers that are needed to create the complete end-to-end solution, leveraging what was learned in Milestone 3. At a high level, these consumers do similar things that the Inventory consumer does. They consume an event from a Kafka topic, publish any errors encountered with processing that event, and then publish a new event to a Kafka topic. The main difference between them is the action each takes when processing an incoming event.*

# Importance to project

*The goal of this milestone is to create the remaining event consumers that are required to complete the system. Once finished, an order can be placed, and communication about the order can traverse through everything that has been built in Milestones 2 through 5.*

# Workflow

## Create a new Notification consumer in Go.

*Create a long-lived subscription to the Notification topic in Kafka.Create functionality that extracts (and logs) the notification information from the relevant event schema.Treat received events in an idempotent manner, meaning any duplicates that are received must not create any side effects within the system. This can be achieved with two potential solutions: configuring the topic to enable idempotence or handling the duplicate checking in the event consumer by tracking the events processed to detect and discard duplicates. Create functionality that publishes an error event containing the received Notification event to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka when the event can’t be processed successfully.Test that the Notification consumer works as expected by posting a Notification event to the Notification topic. Verify that the correct notification information is logged in the Notification consumer. If any errors occurred while processing the Notification event, you should be able to confirm that an event was published to the DeadLetterQueue Kafka topic. The easiest way to verify that an event exists in a topic is to use the command illustrated in Step 5 of the “Apache Kafka Quickstart” guide.*


## Create a new Warehouse consumer in Go.

*Create a long-lived subscription to the OrderConfirmed topic in Kafka.Create functionality that extracts (and logs) the order information from the relevant event schema. Treat received events in an idempotent manner, meaning any duplicates that are received must not create any side effects within the system. This can be achieved with two potential solutions: configuring the topic to enable idempotence or handling the duplicate checking in the event consumer by tracking the events processed to detect and discard duplicates. Create functionality that publishes an error event containing the received OrderConfirmed event to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka when the event can’t be processed successfully. Create functionality that publishes an event notification that the customer’s order is being fulfilled.Test that the Warehouse consumer works as expected by posting an order payload to a running Order service. Verify that the correct order is logged in the Warehouse consumer and a notification event was received by a running the Notification consumer. If any errors occurred while processing the OrderConfirmed event, you should be able to confirm that an event was published to the DeadLetterQueue Kafka topic. The easiest way to verify that an event exists in a topic is to use the command illustrated in Step 5 of the “Apache Kafka Quickstart” guide.*

## Create a new Shipper consumer in Go.

*Create a long-lived subscription to the OrderPickedAndPacked topic in Kafka. Create functionality that extracts (and logs) the order and shipping information from the relevant event schema. Treat received events in an idempotent manner, meaning any duplicates that are received must not create any side effects within the system. This can be achieved with two potential solutions: configuring the topic to enable idempotence or handling the duplicate checking in the event consumer by tracking the events processed in order to detect and discard duplicates. Create functionality that publishes an error event containing the received OrderPickedAndPacked event to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka when the event can’t be processed successfully. Create functionality that publishes an event notification to the customer stating the order is being shipped. Test that the Shipper consumer works as expected by posting an OrderPickedAndPacked event to the OrderPickedAndPacked topic and verify that the correct order is logged in the Shipper consumer and a notification event was received by a running Notification consumer. If any errors occurred while processing the OrderPickedAndPacked event, you should be able to confirm that an event was published to the DeadLetterQueue Kafka topic. The easiest way to verify that an event exists in a topic is to use the command illustrated in Step 5 of the “Apache Kafka Quickstart” guide.*

## Deliverable

*The deliverable for this milestone is three event consumers: Notification, which will be subscribed to the Notification topic in Kafka and can publish error events to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka Warehouse, which will be subscribed to the OrderConfirmed topic in Kafka and can publish events to the Notification topic as well as publish error events to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka Shipper, which will be subscribed to the OrderPickedAndPacked topic in Kafka and can publish events to the Notification topic as well as publish error events to the DeadLetterQueue topic in Kafka*
